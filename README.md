# What is Flappy++?

This is Flappy Bird clone written in C++.
Currently it's being rewritten, cause my old one was litteraly bad.
New version is written in much better way :)

# Before rewrite...

Check how game works before rewrite. It's running on 40FPS when VSync is forced to OFF :D Yeah, thats one thing why I wanted rewrite it :)
